# CT-Pneumonia-Dataset

This repository hosts a unique dataset comprising of 1022 CT images of pneumonia-affected lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The images have been gathered from various international scientific publications and include different types of CT scans such as standard CT, contrast CT, and high-resolution CT.

## Dataset Creation

This dataset was created in response to the lack of a publicly available database of pneumonia-specific CT data. The included cases of pulmonary pneumonia are exclusively those caused by infections due to bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Cases with lung cancer, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), or other lung damages not caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi are excluded from this dataset.

## Metadata

The dataset is accompanied by a metadata document named `[Pneumonia] Metadata.xlsx`. This document contains important information about each image, including the age and sex of the patient, the type of infection, and the scientific articles from which the images were sourced. However, it should be noted that the metadata does not include information about the number of pneumonia patients represented in these images.

### Gender Distribution

The following table shows the distribution of CT images based on gender:

| Gender  | Number of Photos | Percentage (%) |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Male    | 465             | 45.50          |
| Female  | 283             | 27.69          |
| Unknown | 274             | 26.81          |

### Infection Type Distribution

The following table shows the distribution of CT images based on the type of infection:

| Infection Type | Number of Photos | Percentage (%) |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Bacteria       | 326             | 31.90          |
| Virus          | 488             | 47.75          |
| Fungi          | 175             | 17.12          |
| Both           | 14              | 1.37           |
| Unknown        | 19              | 1.86           |
