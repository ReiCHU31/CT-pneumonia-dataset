# CT-Pneumonia-Dataset
This repository contains a unique dataset of 1022 CT images of pneumonia lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These images have been collected from various international scientific publications. The types of CT images included in this dataset are standard CT, contrast CT, and high-resolution CT.

## Dataset Creation
Due to the lack of a publicly available database of pneumonia-only CT data, this dataset was created. The accepted pulmonary pneumonia cases are those caused by any infection due to bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The exclusion criteria include lung cancer, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP), bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP), and other lung damages not caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

## Metadata
All relevant information, including age, sex, types of infection, and the scientific articles from which the images were sourced, are recorded and stored in a metadata document named `[Pneumonia] Metadata.xlsx`. However, it should be noted that there is no information available to identify the number of pneumonia patients covered in these submissions.

## Repository Link
